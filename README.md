# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions and attempts at solutions for
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

This is my first time doing Advent of Code. My goal is just to _try_ to solve
the challenges when I have time and mind to do so, instead of creating a
stressful responsibility for myself.

## Days and Their Solutions

Each day's challenge is two parts, and the reward is a star for each. I've
marked how I did on each challenge next to the day title. Here's a little key:

| Symbol | Meaning                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| ⭐️     | solved challenge                |
| 👎     | tried, couldn't solve challenge |
| 🚫     | didn't try challenge            |

The code beneath each day title can be run in a terminal to show the solution
for that day.

- **Day 01:** [challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) • [solution](./day-01/) • ⭐️ ⭐️

  ```sh
  php ./day-01/1.php && php ./day-01/2.php
  ```
