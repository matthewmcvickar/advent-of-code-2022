# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions and attempts at solutions for
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

This is my first time doing Advent of Code. My goal is just to _try_ to solve
the challenges when I have time and mind to do so, instead of creating a
stressful responsibility for myself.

## Days and Their Solutions

Each day's challenge is two parts, and the reward is a star for each. I've
marked how many stars I got for each challenge next to the day title.

Here's a little key:

- ⭐️ = solved challenge
- 👎 = tried, couldn't solve challenge
- 🚫 = didn't try challenge

The code beneath each day title can be run in a terminal to show the solution
for that day.
