# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions and attempts at solutions for
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

This is my first time doing Advent of Code. My goal is just to _try_ to solve
the challenges when I have time and mind to do so, instead of creating a
stressful responsibility for myself.

## Days and Solutions

Each day's challenge is two parts, and the reward is a star for each. I've
marked how I did on each challenge next to the day title. Here's a little key:

| Symbol | Meaning                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
|   ⭐️   | solved challenge                |
|   👎   | tried, couldn't solve challenge |
|   🚫   | didn't try challenge            |

If you want to run the code yourself, please clone this repository, navigate to
its root directory, and  use the terminal command snippets beneath each day to
run the code and show the solution for that day.
